Recently, my internet has been awash with Lensa.ai images. At first I was resistant, but then I realized that the computers have my everything anyway, so might as well.

I uploaded 20 of my best selfies and paid the $5.99 for 100 AI-generated images and...meh.

The first fairy princess version of myself was fun, the "pop" and "anime" versions of myself were super adorable, but the rest definitely left something to be desired. Not very impressed. But my husband saw the images and of course he asked me to do it for him. So I did and...then I got annoyed! He got super interesting themes like "adventurer" and "astronaut." My son wanted some too and he looks like he's straight out of a detective video game...and rock star! Um, my "wait wtf" radar just went off.

When you upload the selfies/photos of yourself, you're asked to pick one of three genders. "Female", "Male" and "Other." I am not going to go into the "other" as a gender, I think it's reductive and I'm sure someone else will write an article about it. But I noticed it and was annoyed by it.

Anyway, after seeing my husband's cool "GTA meets Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas" images, I decided to do an experiment. 

## My Experiment

Now, my sample size is small so this isn't a proper experiment by any means, so this should be considerd anecdotal. 

People involved:
- Me: identify as a female.
- My husband: identifies as a male, has facial hair.
- My son: identifies as a male, teenager and no facial hair.

I have seven (7) samples of 100 ai-generated avatars each.

- female x3
- male x3
- other x1

### Categories

I was mostly interested in what kind of categories seemed "assigned" to a gender, mostly because I hate feeling typecast.

So I uploaded the same set of 20 selfies of me for each gender to see what results I would get. I also compared my results to my husband and son's results.

|                 | Female   | Male   |   Other |
|-----------------|:--------:|:------:|:-------:|
| Adventure       |          |X       |         |

| Cosmic          |X         |X       |X        |
| Cyborg          |          |X       |X        |

| Fantasy         |X         |        |X        |
| Fairy Princess  |X         |        |         |
| Focus           |X         |        |         |
| Iridescent      |X         |        |         |
| Kawaii          |X         |        |         |
| Light           |X         |        |X        |
| Mystical        |          |X       |X        |
| Pop             |X         |        |         |
| Sci-Fi          |          |X       |X        |
| Stylish         |X         |X       |X        |
| Superhero       |          |X       |X        |
| Rainbow         |          |        |X        |
| Rock Star       |          |X       |         |

The male gender got a lot more interesting categories and resulting images. They could definitely give women the rock star category, there were plenty of my "male rockstar" avatars that were pretty great. The only one that was blatantly sexist was the "astronaut" category-- each of my avatars had facial hair! I was irritated by that, and not only because I kind of wanted to see what "Astronaut Mel" would look like. 

One really interesting pattern stood out to me more than the rest. My "female" avatars had distinctly disdainful looks on their faces...but none of my "male" avatars did. The machine definitely knows resting bitch face. Very annoying.

## Closing Thoughts

**I would have done this more but...** I only did this a few times because it's `$5.99` each time but if I could, I'd be really interested to run this a lot more times but I am not interested in giving this app any more of my money. 

**Sexy?** I [read an article](https://www.technologyreview.com/2022/12/12/1064751/the-viral-ai-avatar-app-lensa-undressed-me-without-my-consent/) about another woman's experience of getting over-sexualized ai-generated avatars back. I did not experience this. For clarity, one of my selfies had some cleavage in it, none of the rest did. So I'd be curious to see if feeding the machine "sexier" photos will return more dramatic results.

**Other is a joke** It's very clear that some of these are just fillers for the count. There were more distorted ai-generated images for the set where I chose "other" as my gender. The "Rainbow" category definitely produced the highest number of distorted images. It was really kind of grotesque. Kawaii and Cyber Scientist were also higher on the distorted image count.
