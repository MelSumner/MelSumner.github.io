I spent about two weeks in Ireland, and I want to write this all down because inevitably I will forget and it will all become a blur. This is probably going to be long and have a lot of details in it. If you're just here for the a11y, feel free to skip this one all together.

## Why Ireland

I have been fortunate enough to be invited to speak at [EmberFest](https://emberfest.eu) for a few years now; they hold their annual fall conference in a different European city each year. This year it was in Dublin, and I was once again asked to speak. The company that I work for sponsored the conference by sponsoring my travel, and I am grateful to them for that. EmberFest is a small conference but the community is deeply genuine and tight-knit and it is one of the few joys of my life to be with this group of folks once a year. There is not only the joy of seeing folks you've come to know and care about over the years, but also a sense of sharing knowledge that is beyond the technical reasons we were all there. It's nice to get to know folks and hear about their lives and their families. There's also the added benefit of being outside quite a bit; I tend to get a lot of walking in while I'm there, and it's a great reset to have right before the winter comes to Chicago and I'm just _inside_ for 3-5 months. 

Now, here's the bonus bit: my husband and I have our 10-year wedding anniversary coming up this year (November 21st). However, our son is in his senior year of high school, and going on an anniversary trip during his semester finals and right before Thanksgiving (US Holiday) just wasn't something we could do. Or _would_ do. The thought of not doing anything was equally untenable. So we thought, why not have a celebratory trip a little earlier in the year? And why not add a week to my existing travel plans, since I was going anyway? So we started planning; I would go for the conference, but instead of flying straight home, he would fly out and join me, and we would adventure!

So we started to look at our options and see what would fall into place. Of course, I have wanted to visit Scotland for as long as I can remember; not only am I deeply familiar with my Scottish family heritage (I can trace my ancestry back to Malcolm I of Scotland), I am also drawn to the wild beauty of the country. We'd planned a trip in 2020 but lockdown changed all of that. We thought maybe he could fly into Dublin and meet me there, and then we would go to Scotland. Endinburgh seemed like a solid option. We even used Chat GPT to plot out some potential itineraries and lists of things to do/see. But in the end, there was no clear winner, so I asked my Mastodon feed where they'd opt to spend some time after explaining our ideas. Jeremy Keith (aka @adactio) chimed in on one of my posts. The relevant bit was this: "If it's an option, I'd recommend hopping on the train from Dublin to Galway and hanging out there--I love Galway!"

That's when we knew what we'd do.

We ditched the plans for Scotland (for now!!) and decided to focus our attention on Ireland for our trip. We'd spend a day in Dublin after he arrived, then take a train to Galway and stay there for most of our time. Then we'd come back a day or two before our flight home for a little more Dublin time. We also decided that we'd rent a car (I still drive, my husband hasn't since we moved to Chicago in 2015) and explore Western Ireland. Specifically, the Cliffs of Moher were the top of Joseph's list. I'm all for epic landscapes on the edge of an ocean, being a Big Sur fan myself, so we decided that if we only did one thing, we would make sure we saw the Cliffs of Moher. We added in some other things, tentatively; museums in Dublin, Kylemore Abbey, lots of pubs, and definitely some Aran Islands shopping.

## What We Did

So here's how the itinerary worked out:

1. Day 0: I flew overnight from Chicago to Dublin, landed on a Wednesday around 11am.
2. Day 1: That night (Wednesday), I went to a speaker's dinner for the conference.
3. Day 2-3: The next two days (Thursday and Friday) I attended the conference and after conference events.
4. Day 4-5: Saturday and Sunday were mine to do with as I wished.
5. Day 6: My husband did the same overnight flight, leaving Sunday night and arriving midday on Monday.
6. Day 7: On Tuesday we took a train from Dublin to Galway.
7. Day 8: On Wednesday we went to the Cliffs of Moher, and accidentally visited Burren National Park
8. Day 9: On Thursday we went to Kylemore Abbey and Clifden
9. Day 10: On Friday we hung out in Galway, more of the touristy bits
10. Day 11: On Saturday, we packed a little bit, then ended up in the Salthill area for dinner and walked along the coast for a while. We ended up seeing the Famine Ship Memorial.
11. Day 12: On Sunday, we took a train back to Dublin, explored the castle, hung out with a friend and his two little girls, and went to a rose garden.
12. Day 13: We flew back to Chicago. So weird to land two hours after you left...
13. Day 14: We hung out with our cats and got them to forgive us a little bit for being gone for so long.

## Travel Details

This is the stuff that folks might be curious to know about, or I just might want to remember for future trips.

### Planes, trains, and automobiles

I am a creature of habit when it comes to travel; I fly United Airlines, and I stay at some type of Marriott...unless I can't. It's made things easier for me in my professional life. But for some reason, flying United to Europe seems prohibitively expensive; the seat that cost me $1800 (USD) on American was pricing around $5k (USD) on United. Boo. Hotels seem to go the same way. At least $400 (USD) a night, when other hotels are both nicer and less expensive. I don't know what gives, nor do I care to find out. I guess I just keep my travel habits for my domestic adventures. 

I flew to Ireland on an American Airlines flight, direct from Chicago to Dublin. Business class, or Premium Economy, depending on what screen I was looking at. It was kind of weird, usually there's economy, business, and first for international flights, and that makes things nice and easy. Business class is like first class when flying domestic. 

We rented a car. This was the part that I was worried about until I remembered that I have been driving for nearly 30 years now, and even if it was on the ~~wrong~~ other side of the road I'd be fine. Then I was worried about being charged for things unexpectedly, because Reddit is full of stories like this. So I called ahead and managed to find out what the fees really were. When we got there, a couple was offended that their American car insurance wasn't going to be accepted and decided to cancel their car reservation entirely; I was glad I called ahead.
