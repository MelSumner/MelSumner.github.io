Today marks the 25th year of my first foray into building something for the internet. Happy web-versary to me! It seems like forever ago, but it also seems like just yesterday. I suppose this is the nature of how time passes, or feels like it happens. If you are focusing on it then it doesn't seem like any time has passed at all, but if you ignore it for a bit it just flies by.

I have avoided blogging in any meaningful way; it has never been a nice experience, being a woman on the internet. Now, though, I am old enough not to really care, and young enough to still remember the things that have happened and want to write them down.

Of course, perfection has been the enemy of the...good enough. At least, until now. As a [person-who-makes-things-for-the-web](https://melanie.codes) but also as an accessibility expert and always talking about how we need to make the web more accessible, I can tell you that all blogging platforms are terrible. Either they are a pain to use, or a pain to set up, or break every release, or just horribly not accessible. So I haven't blogged, because everything sucks and who has the time and hasn't everyone else said everything anyway?

I think the title of my next book will be "lies and other rationalizations of software engineers." It would be a best-seller, I bet.

Anyway. If this publishes successfully to GitHub pages, then I will really have no excuse anymore, since I can write in markdown (essential) and push to GitHub (also essential) and have it publish automatically (absolutely completely essential). Really, I've been looking for something like "CodePen-as-a-blog" or "GitHub-gists-as-a-blog" and I think this is the closest I will get without way too much heavy lifting on my part.

I also have an RSS feed, because that's conveniently built in and I didn't have to figure it out. Very convenient.

Until next time.
